1. If you want to create a folder in Controllers section, you can do it 
   with command:

   Important !!!   Use / instead of \

   php artisan make:controller Backend/LayoutController



2. In controller run  content.blade.php and not admin_layout.blade.php:
   
      public function index(){
        return view('admin.content');
    }

    you're trying to display a content and not the whole admin file !!!



3. In includes specify the path:

   @include('admin.layout.sidebar')



4. In layout parts: header.blade.php, sidebar.blade.php and
   footer.blade.php you don't have to write:

   @extends() & @section, @endsection structure
   
   meta tags and etc ...
   with a ! (emmet) shortcut. Just write that element's code:

   <footer>

      etc ... 

   </footer>


   Now, if you have views that aren't being included in a master
   layout with a @include() tag, unlike header, sidebar, footer,
   then you have to use these tags:

   @extends() & @section, @endsection

   in order to display the structure of the page


5. You don't have to create routes in web.php that already are
   created by Laravel (in the: php artisan route:list). These are
   default routes, so just use them



6. To logout from page, logout uses GET method and a <a href=""></a> 
   link. You have to create it in the default HomeController, with:  
   Auth::logout()
